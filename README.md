# ObjectId String Comparison in MongoDB
This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB queries: using the `$in` operator with ObjectIds represented as strings instead of ObjectId objects.  This will lead to incorrect query results. The solution shows the correct way to use `$in` with ObjectIds.

## Bug
The original code attempts to query documents where the `_id` field is in a given array of ObjectIds. However, it passes the ObjectIds as strings, causing the query to fail to find the matching documents because of type mismatch. 

## Solution
The solution converts the string ObjectIds into actual ObjectId objects using the `ObjectId()` function from the MongoDB driver before executing the query. This ensures the correct type comparison and produces the expected results.
